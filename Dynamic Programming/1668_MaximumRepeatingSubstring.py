LeetCode 1668: Maximum Repeating Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-repeating-substring/

Approach:
- We need to find the maximum number of times `word` can repeat consecutively in `sequence`.
- Iterate through each character index `i` in `sequence`:
  - At each index, check if `word` repeats consecutively starting at `i`.
  - Use a nested loop to repeatedly match substrings of length `len(word)`.
  - Count how many times `word` repeats in a row (`rep`).
  - Update `max_rep` with the maximum value of `rep` seen so far.
  - If a match occurred, move `i` back by one `word` length to avoid skipping possible overlaps.
- Continue until all possible positions are checked.

Example:
sequence = "ababc", word = "ab" â†’ Output: 2  
Explanation: "ab" repeats twice starting at index 0.

Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n = len(sequence) and m = len(word)
Space Complexity: O(1)
