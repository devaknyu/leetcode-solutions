LeetCode 169: Majority Element
https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/

Approach: Boyerâ€“Moore Voting Algorithm
- Keep track of a candidate and a counter.
- Reset candidate when counter is 0.
- Increase counter if current element == candidate, otherwise decrease.
- Guaranteed that the final candidate is the majority element.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
